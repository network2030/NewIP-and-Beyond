<span style="font-size: large; color:#9B032F"> Less Data, More Knowledge: Reasoning Foundations of Semantic Communication Networks </span>

*Abstract:* For decades, the wireless link between transmitter and receiver has been seen as a mere  bit pipe whose goal is to faithfully reconstruct the exact transmitted signal at the receiver without paying attention to the meaning or effect of the source message. This classical design may excel in delivering high communication rates and low bit-level errors, but its limitations become apparent when faced with the challenge of transmitting massive data streams for connected intelligence, Internet of Senses, or holographic applications, where the message intent and effectiveness must be considered, and extremely stringent requirements for reliability and latency must be met, often simultaneously. In this regard, the concept of semantic communication, in which the meaning of the source messages is incorporated in the design of a communication link, has recently emerged as a promising solution. However, despite a recent surge of efforts in this area, remarkably, the research landscape is still limited to basic constructs in which even the very definition of “semantics” remains ambiguous. In this talk, we seek to remove this ambiguity and present a bold, forward-looking vision of how to build and design semantic communication networks from the ground up. In particular, we opine that major breakthroughs in semantic communications can only be made by equipping the communication nodes with the capability to exploit information semantics at a fundamental level (from the data structure and relationships) which enables them to build a knowledge base, reason on their data, and engage in the form of communication using a machine language, similar to human conversation, with the capability to deduce meaning from the data in a manner akin to human reasoning. Towards this goal, we introduce our holistic vision for semantic communications that is firmly grounded in rigorous artificial intelligence (AI) and causal reasoning foundations, with the potential to revolutionize the way information is modeled, transmitted, and processed in communication systems. We show how, by embracing semantic communication through our proposed vision, we can usher in a new era of knowledge-driven, reasoning wireless networks that are more sustainable and resilient than today’s data-driven, knowledge-agnostic networks. We also shed light on how this framework can create AI-native networks – a key requirement of future wireless systems. As a key step towards enabling this paradigm shift, we present our recent key results in this area, with foundations in AI, theory of mind, and game theory, that showcase how the proposed approach for semantic communications can reduce the volume of data circulating in a network while improving reliability, two critical requirements for emerging wireless services, such as connected intelligence and digital twins. We conclude with a discussion of future opportunities in this exciting area.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">CALL FOR PAPERS</h2>

Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) integration is an ambitious mission in 3GPP to extend the Internet to sky and outer space. Currently, 
NTN has been widely accepted as a major roadblock for 6G. One of the goals of 6G is to enable large-scale Low Earth Orbit (LEO) 
satellite constellations to form different moving networks that can be integrated with the Internet. In the future, LEO satellite 
networks will become part of the Internet and be used for 5G/6G wireless access and back-haul network for wireless service providers, 
and transport network for terrestrial service providers. 
Moreover, the use of LEO satellite constellations also has its own technical challenges as these constellations move at high velocity 
(>7 km/s) and use over 10k satellites plus millions of ground stations. Various challenges need to be addressed, spanning multiple 
areas such as direct cellphone-to-satellite connectivity, wireless access architecture utilizing gNB on LEO satellites, power management 
and antenna technology for both end-user devices and satellites, IP-capable satellites, and large-scale satellite networks, free 
space optical communication for inter-satellite-link (ISL), tracking technology for ISL, and ground stations, among others.

On the other hand, 6G communication intends to shift the conventional symbol-based communication systems 
that are nearing the Shannon capacity limit to Qualitative and Semantic Communications. These communications 
share the same principle: the intended message to be transmitted by the sender does not need to be matched bit-by-bit 
to the received message. Qualitative Communication enables the receiver to consume some portion of the packet or a 
modified version of the packet in a timely manner. Similarly, Semantic Communication focuses on the significance of 
transmitted symbols or bits. In this paradigm, a transmission that involves distorted symbols does not necessarily 
indicate semantic errors, and the receiver can still acquire the intended message. 

These new paradigms aim to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of communication systems to support the 
demanding applications of 6G. To fully realize the potential of these emerging communication paradigms, further 
research and development are required. Achieving this objective includes a meticulous redesign of network architecture, 
network protocols, information encoding, processing, decoding, packet transmission, routing, and other related components.

This workshop aims to bring together researchers, practitioners, and industry experts to present and discuss 
recent advancements and future directions for 6G enablers: Satellite, Qualitative, and Semantic Communications.

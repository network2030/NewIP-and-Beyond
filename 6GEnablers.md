<h2 style="text-align: center;">CALL FOR PAPERS</h2>

Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) integration is an ambitious mission in 3GPP to extend the Internet to sky and outer space. Currently, 
NTN has been widely accepted as a major roadblock for 6G. One of the goals of 6G is to enable large-scale Low Earth Orbit (LEO) 
satellite constellations to form different moving networks that can be integrated with the Internet. In the future, LEO satellite 
networks will become part of the Internet and be used for 5G/6G wireless access and back-haul network for wireless service providers, 
and transport network for terrestrial service providers. 
Moreover, the use of LEO satellite constellations also has its own technical challenges as these constellations move at high velocity 
(>7 km/s) and use over 10k satellites plus millions of ground stations. Various challenges need to be addressed, spanning multiple 
areas such as direct cellphone-to-satellite connectivity, wireless access architecture utilizing gNB on LEO satellites, power management 
and antenna technology for both end-user devices and satellites, IP-capable satellites, and large-scale satellite networks, free 
space optical communication for inter-satellite-link (ISL), tracking technology for ISL, and ground stations, among others.

On the other hand, 6G communication intends to shift the conventional symbol-based communication systems 
that are nearing the Shannon capacity limit to Qualitative and Semantic Communications. These communications 
share the same principle: the intended message to be transmitted by the sender does not need to be matched bit-by-bit 
to the received message. Qualitative Communication enables the receiver to consume some portion of the packet or a 
modified version of the packet in a timely manner. Similarly, Semantic Communication focuses on the significance of 
transmitted symbols or bits. In this paradigm, a transmission that involves distorted symbols does not necessarily 
indicate semantic errors, and the receiver can still acquire the intended message. 

These new paradigms aim to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of communication systems to support the 
demanding applications of 6G. To fully realize the potential of these emerging communication paradigms, further 
research and development are required. Achieving this objective includes a meticulous redesign of network architecture, 
network protocols, information encoding, processing, decoding, packet transmission, routing, and other related components.

This workshop aims to bring together researchers, practitioners, and industry experts to present and discuss 
recent advancements and future directions for 6G enablers: Satellite, Qualitative, and Semantic Communications.
